# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Classification-CNN-EfficientNetB1

🧠 Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN & Grad-CAM

This project focuses on automated brain tumor detection using deep learning, leveraging EfficientNetB1-based CNNs for MRI classification. To enhance model interpretability, Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is used to generate heatmaps, highlighting tumor-affected regions. Additionally, a Large Language Model (LLM) generates structured heatmap analysis reports, providing insights into model attention without making a medical diagnosis.
📌 Features:

✅ Deep Learning Model: EfficientNetB1-based CNN trained to classify MRI scans into four categories (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor).
✅ Explainability with Grad-CAM: Heatmaps visualize the model's focus, aiding AI transparency.
✅ LLM-Powered Heatmap Analysis: Generates structured reports describing highlighted regions without providing medical diagnoses.
✅ Performance Evaluation: Assessed using AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score.
✅ Scalability & Deployment: Designed for potential healthcare and medical research applications.
🛠️ Tech Stack:

    Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, EfficientNetB1
    Visualization: Matplotlib, OpenCV, Grad-CAM
    LLM Integration: Gemini 1.5 / GPT-4V (for heatmap analysis)
    Dataset: MRI scans from publicly available sources (e.g., Kaggle)
